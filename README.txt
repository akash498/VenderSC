Github Protocol:
	
	Just to make sure everyone is on the same page, do a pull before working on the project. Before creating a page, please text in the 
	group chat what work you are doing so that we do not have any overlap. Also, only update the files in the repo that you have worked
	on (Do not copy your entire webpages folder in your eclipse workspace to your local repository and then push, only copy over the 
	specific pages you worked on).
