IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are doing a page that does NOT have a scrolling element, use the footer from AddProductPage, else use the footer from template file. 

DEBUGGING: If you are getting errors that your pictures or font are not loading, check the html. In eclipse, I use "../css/filename.css", try
taking the "../" out of the url.
